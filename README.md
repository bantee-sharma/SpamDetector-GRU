# SpamDetector-GRU
**ðŸ“Œ Spam Email Detection using GRU**


This project builds a Spam Email Classifier using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) in TensorFlow/Keras. 

It leverages SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle data imbalance and improve classification accuracy.




ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Preprocessing: Tokenization, Padding, and Train-Test Split
âœ… Data Balancing: SMOTE applied to handle spam/ham imbalance
âœ… Model: GRU-based Neural Network for text classification
âœ… Evaluation: Accuracy, Loss, and Confusion Matrix
âœ… Prediction: Detects if an email is Spam (ðŸ”´) or Not Spam (ðŸŸ¢)
